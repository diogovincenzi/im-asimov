All work done by Diogo "v1per" Vincenzi.

Installation
-------------------------------------------

Copy GameData folder to root of your KSP game folder.

To use the alternate texture for the command module, grab the file command_module_difuse.dds and copy it to
GameData\IncredibleMachines\Asimov\Parts\asimov_commandmodule. When prompted to replace, confirm it.

I'll try to have a better system in a future release.
